ðŸ›  What Did I Do?
- Developed the game using ReactJS: Used React state and props to manage game logic and rendering.
- Implemented player turns: Alternates between X and O on each move.
- Win detection logic and Restart feature: Checks for a winner after every move and declares the winner and a "Restart" option at the end of the game.
- Draw detection: Recognizes when the board is full without a winner.
- Styled using CSS: Designed a clean and responsive UI for an engaging experience.
- Built with Vite: Ensured a fast and optimized development setup.
